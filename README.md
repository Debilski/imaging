Imaging Lift Module
==================

This module provides image-related utilities.

To include this module in your Lift project, update your `libraryDependencies` in `build.sbt` to include:

*Lift 2.5.x* for Scala 2.9 and 2.10:

    "net.liftmodules" %% "imaging_2.5" % "1.2"

*Lift 3.0.x* for Scala 2.10:

    "net.liftmodules" %% "imaging_3.0" % "1.2-SNAPSHOT"

**Note:** The module package changed from `net.liftweb.imaging` to `net.liftmodules.imaging` in May 2012.  Please consider this when referencing documentation written before that date.

Notes for module developers
===========================

* The [Jenkins build](https://liftmodules.ci.cloudbees.com/job/imaging/) is triggered on a push to master.
